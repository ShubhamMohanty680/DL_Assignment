    "The purpose of applying a softmax function in the output layer during forward propagation is to produce a probability distribution over multiple classes. The softmax function is commonly used as an activation function in the output layer of a neural network for multi-class classification tasks. Here's why it is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Probability interpretation:** The softmax function transforms the outputs of the neural network into a set of probabilities. It ensures that the values in the output vector sum up to 1 and represent the likelihood or probability of the input belonging to each class. This property makes softmax suitable for multi-class classification problems where each input can be assigned to one of several mutually exclusive classes.\n",

By selecting the class with the highest probability, we can determine the most likely prediction of the neural network for a given input.\n",

Backpropagation enables the network to learn from its mistakes and improve its performance over time. Here's an overview of the key roles and steps involved in backpropagation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Error calculation:** Initially, during the forward propagation step, the network predicts an output based on the given input. The predicted output is then compared to the true or desired output, and the error or loss is calculated. The specific method of error calculation depends on the task at hand, such as mean squared error (MSE) for regression or cross-entropy loss for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Backward pass:** The error is then propagated backward through the network, starting from the output layer towards the input layer. This backward pass involves computing the gradients of the error with respect to the weights and biases of each neuron in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Gradient computation:** To compute the gradients, the chain rule of calculus is used. The gradients indicate the sensitivity of the network's error to changes in the weights and biases of each neuron. This information helps identify which weights and biases contribute most to the overall error and need adjustment.\n",

This iterative process continues for a specified number of epochs, gradually adjusting the weights and biases to minimize the error."
